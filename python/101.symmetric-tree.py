# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]'
#
# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
# around its center).
#
# For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
#
#
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠/ \ / \
# 3  4 4  3
#
#
#
#
# But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
#
#
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠  \   \
# ⁠  3    3
#
#
#
#
# Note:
# Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def isSym(L, R):
            if not L and not R:
                return True
            if L and R and L.val == R.val:
                return isSym(L.left, R.right) and isSym(L.right, R.left)
            return False
        return isSym(root, root)
