#
# Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
# 
# The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 orÂ 0.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: 'str', b: 'str') -> 'str':
        return bin(int(a, 2) + int(b, 2))[2:]
